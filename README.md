# cell_image_inspection
1. Run cell_extraction.py to extract cells from modified layout. In this case we have modified layout for the ease of implementation. We assume this modified layout is the true layout and captured SEM image has trojan<br />
2. Run cell_addition_deletion.py to check the added or deleted cells.<br />
3. Run cell_modification.py to check and find out the modified cells.<br />
4. Both checking has been done on selective inputs. The process has not been adapted to real-time yet. It's just a demo how the system will analyze in 
real time. We are going to update the algorithms and make it compatible for real-time analysis in future.<br />
